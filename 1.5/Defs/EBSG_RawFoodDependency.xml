        <description>Carriers of this gene have a biological dependency for raw food, requiring frequent consumption to survive. After 5 days without consumption, carriers will suffer from deficiency. After 30 days, they will fall into a coma. After 60 days, they will die.\n\nAs a side effect of this gene, the carrier's digestive system is capable of handling all forms of food poisoning. This dependency will not improve how much nutrition they get from the food though. This gene also won't get rid of the associated thought, which can leave pawns very upset about their nature.</description>
