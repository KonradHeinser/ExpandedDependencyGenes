Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod seeks to expand the dependency system by adding several new depenedency genes that expand the range of options considerably.

Notes about the chemical reliance genes. They are in a different section because the way normal chemical genes were coded made it so I had no reliable way to add to that list. If you have some modded in chemical genes, you may also notice that those don't have a reliance variant, which is an issue caused by the same source. If there are other chemicals you'd like to see added to the list please mention them in the comments along with a link to the relevant mod.

No, I will not be adding Luciferium to the list for the same reason I didn't add it to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013604316]More Drug Genes[/url]. he normal addiction is so severe that I would need to set the reliance to kill the pawn after 7 days, put them in a coma after 3.5 days, and make them suffer deficiency after 0.58 days. which are intervals so extreme it would need to provide around 20 metabolic efficiency. Put more succinctly, it would not be a Biotech Style Gene due to its extremes.
